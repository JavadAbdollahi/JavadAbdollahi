# Hi, I'm Javad 👋

### 📐 Exploring the World of Mathematics & Algorithms

I am a **Mathematics and Applications** student with a deep curiosity about how abstract theories can model the real world. My journey is focused on understanding **Mathematical Modeling**, learning **Graph Theory**, and developing an **Algorithmic Mindset**.

I enjoy the process of learning and am constantly trying to translate mathematical concepts into code to understand real-life problems better.
